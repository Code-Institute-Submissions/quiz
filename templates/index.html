            <p class="instructions">You will be faced with 15 images of exotic fruits - your task is to try and guess the correct name
                for each fruit. For every correct answer, you will receive 5 points and move onto the next one. However, if your guess is incorrect
                you will lose 5 points and your incorrect guess will be displayed below the quiz. If you choose to skip an image, you will move onto
                the next one however you will lose 2 points. Once you have completed all 15 images, you will be taken to the leaderboard to see if your
                score made it into the Top 10. Have fun!
