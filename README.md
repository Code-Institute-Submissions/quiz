# Exotic Fruits Quiz

## UX

This web application is made for those who like to do quizzes for entertainment or to test their knowledge on what the quiz's topic is. My target market could more specifically
include students within the Food Technology sector who wish to test their knowledge on exotic fruits, teachers who wish to test these students, or people who just enjoy taking
random quizzes for their own enjoyment. This type of user will want to be able to enter a unique username, be presented with questions and be given an input area for their answer.
This user will also want to be able to view their score once they have completed the quiz and compare it to other player's scores, with the choice to restart the quiz. 
My project is a suitable way of achieving this because it provides a form for the user to use when they want to choose a unique username, fifteen images of exotic fruits and a form
for each image whereby the user may guess the name for each fruit. Once they have completed the quiz, a highscores table will be presented with the top ten scores and the user can choose 
to replay the quiz if they would like to achieve a higher score. The brief requires the web application to allow multiple users to do the quiz at the same time - my project allows this
and each player's name and score can be stored at the same time, even if users are using different browsers.

General User Stories:

- As a user type, I want to be able to enter a unique username and proceed to start the quiz.
- As a user type, I would like to be able to find out how to play the quiz.
- As a user type, I would like to compare my final score with other scores.
- As a user type, I would like to be able to play the quiz at the same time as other users.
